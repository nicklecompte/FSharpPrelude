/// Generic inductively-defined directed graph structure. We consider a Graph<'TVertex> as being represented by
/// the pair {E,V} where E \subset 'TVertex and V \subset 'TVertex*'TVertex
(*
Some comments:
    - Note that hypergraphs are NOT supported, but loops are supported.
    - Although it would be more proper to create undirected graphs by Overlay( (Connected(a,b)), (Connected(b,a)),
        it is probably more sensible for the caller to "assume" and simply check (v1,v2) or (v2,v1) for adjacency, returning true when the first one hits.
